    "Templates for a GSM-R-style training/app overlay mapped to SimSig-style responses. Wording is designed to follow UK 'safety critical communications' principles (identify, location, instruction, readback/confirmation for safety-critical authorities).",

    "SimSig implementations vary by simulation, era, core version, and timetable scripting; mappings here target common Loader-era reply sets (e.g., red-signal waiting menu) and otherwise map to SimSig-equivalent actions (e.g., slot buttons)."
